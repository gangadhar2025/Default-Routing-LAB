Deaffault Route:
  
  when you try to reach unkown route from layer 3 device , the packet goes to gateway, 
that gateway ip is wifi router ip.

if a computer or router doesn't know where to send data, it will send it to a default gateway, which will try to find the destination.

after configuring the default route on the router and when you try to reach any destination ip address 
if that address is not in the routing table , it will choos default root 

(0.0.0.0/0) represent unknown route in default routing (0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 next-hop ip address )

Here is 192.168.12.2 is ISP-1 gateway metric is 10
and 192.168.13.3 is ISP-2 Gateway metric 50 is assigned, here the route with lowest metric value 
is preferred as best route

Verification 

we have a configured two default routes in main router one is towards ISP-1 with cost 10 and 
another one is towrads ISP-2 with cost value 50 

initiat a trace route to 8.8.8.8 from PC and confirm 

incase if ISP-1 goes down , it chooses the ISP-2 path to reach 8.8.8.8 google server ip 
shutdown the link f0/0 on main router 

conclusion 

here we can default routing generally configured on office routers , when you have 2 or more isps 
connections , you can configure default route towards ISP and hence users can acces the internet

default routig AD value is 1, lower value prefer the best path 

here we implemented Default routing and static routing.
